The nsp1-40S ribosome complex further induces an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5'UTR of host mRNAs, targeting them for degradation. Viral mRNAs are not susceptible to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage thanks to the presence of a 5'-end leader sequence and are therefore protected from degradation. By suppressing host gene expression, nsp1 facilitates efficient viral gene expression in infected cells and evasion from host immune response.",
