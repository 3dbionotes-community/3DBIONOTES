In the following lines, we suppose you have an element identified as *yourDiv*. Do not forget to add a link to the js and the css.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <script src=\"biojs-vis-proteinFeaturesViewer.js\"></script>\r\n    <link href=\"main.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"/>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <div id='yourDiv'/>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can include the component in your code and create an instance. In order to create an instance, you need to provide some configuration options. Particularly, you need to specify the object where the component will be located, *el*, as well as the UniProt accession whose sequence annotations will be visualized, *uniprotacc*. \r\n```javascript\r\nvar yourDiv = document.getElementById('yourDiv');\r\nvar biojs_vis_proteinFeaturesViewer = require('biojs-vis-proteinfeaturesviewer');\r\nvar instance = new biojs_vis_proteinFeaturesViewer({\r\n  el: yourDiv, \r\n  uniprotacc : 'UniProt_accession'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a third option that can be specified, *pinPad* with possible values *true* or *false*. This option is used to activate a notepad on the right where tooltip can be pinned. If you set up that option to true, you **must** include pp_main.css.\r\n\r\n## Events\r\nThe Protein Feature viewer triggers five events. In order to listen to those events, you need to get the dispacher.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ninstance.getDispatcher().on(\"ready\", function() {\r\n    console.log('ready');\r\n});\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### \"ready\"\r\nAs soon as data has been loaded and visualized, this event will be triggered.\r\n\r\n### \"featureSelected\"\r\nAs soon as a feature has been selected, meaning a click on it has happened, this event will be triggered. The data provided by this event looks like:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  \"feature\":{\r\n    \"type\":{\"name\":\"REGION\",\"label\":\"region of interest\"},\r\n    \"description\":\"Heparin-binding\",\r\n    \"begin\":\"96\",\r\n    \"end\":\"110\",\r\n    \"internalId\":\"ft_65\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"color\":\"rgb(179, 62, 0)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \"featureDeselected\"\r\nAs soon as a feature has been deselected, this event will be triggered. A feature is deselected when it is selected and a clicked on it happens, or when another feature is selected. The data provided by this event looks like the one provided by the event \"featureSelected\".\r\n\r\n### \"noData\"\r\nTriggered when the data failed to be loaded. the data provided by this event will be an error return by a jQuery.ajax request.\r\n\r\n### \"noFeatures\"\r\nTriggered when the Uniprot accession has no sequence annotations.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease submit all issues and pull requests to the [ebi-uniprot/biojs-vis-proteinFeaturesViewer](http://github.com/ebi-uniprot/biojs-vis-proteinFeaturesViewer) repository!\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nIf you have any problem or suggestion please open an issue [here](https://github.com/ebi-uniprot/biojs-vis-proteinFeaturesViewer/issues).\r\n\r\n## License \r\nThis software is licensed under the Apache 2 license, quoted below.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014, ebi-uniprot\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not\r\nuse this file except in compliance with the License.
